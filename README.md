# Module13Challenge
Neural Networks

This Jupyter notebook uses Scikit-learn, TensorFlow and Keras to create a binary classification model (using a deep neural network) to predict whether Alphabet Soup funding applicants will be successful.

## Technologies

This project leverages jupyterlab version 3.2.1.

## Usage

Ensure the conda dev environment is activated. Using CLI, please launch the jupyter lab.

Original Model: Open the venture_funding_with_deep_learning.ipynb. Restart the kernel.  
Optimization Attempt 1 (Model 1): Open the M1_venture_funding_with_deep_learning.ipynb. Restart the kernel.  
Optimization Attempt 2 (Model 2): Open the M2_venture_funding_with_deep_learning.ipynb. Restart the kernel.

Please refer to jupyter notebooks for answers to the questions in the assignment.

HDF5 (Hierarchical DataFormat) files associated with the above three models have been uploaded in the Resources folder.
